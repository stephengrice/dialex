# rails-auth-template

Clone this project to get a quick start with Rails authentication.

I made this for myself because I have gone through [Greg Buckner's helpful instructions](https://gist.github.com/thebucknerlife/10090014) way too many times. Those are the directions I used to create this project.

Mr. Buckner provides a [boilerplate](https://github.com/thebucknerlife/auth_boilerplate) too, but I like to do things myself. His boilerplate is better documented than this one, so check it out.

This project uses Rails 5.
